Yet Another Log Viewer


## Dependencies

- [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan): a JSON logging library for node.js services
- [node-cron-jobs](https://github.com/marsinvasion/node-cron-jobs): Schedules cron like jobs

Bunyan and Node cron jobs are used to generate logs. This is obviously not needed in your environment where your application generates the logs.
